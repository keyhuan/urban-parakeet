To summarize what we covered in this article:
First of all, it’s most important to find the “right” data source, as any downstream data work should be data-centric.
Second, exploratory data analysis is the first step of any data project so that we could understand everything before we make any assumptions and decisions.
Third, there are many useful python libraries already for data analysis that you could import first to assist in discovering the data insights.
Fourth, there could be different data representations/visualizations, especially for different data types (e.g., continuous, discrete, categorical). Create mocks before jumping into visualizations.
Lastly, presenting the insights to influence others is the key to this deliverable.

Happy “snorkeling” and we’ll “deep dive” soon!
